.SH NAME
\f[CB]vusu\f[R] \[en] set the default networking stack
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[CB]vusu\f[R] [\f[I]options\f[R]] [\-] [\f[I]user\f[R]
[*argment\&...]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[CB]vusu\f[R] allows to run commands with a substitute user and group
ID (in VUOS).
It requires a module loaded in VUOS able to redefine uid/gid,
e.g.\ \f[CB]unrealuidgid\f[R].
.PP
When called without arguments, \f[CB]vusu\f[R] defaults to running an
interactive shell as (virtual) \f[I]root\f[R].
.PP
For compatibility with \f[CB]su\f[R](1), \f[CB]vusu\f[R] defaults to not
change the current directory and to only set the environment variables
\f[CB]HOME\f[R] and \f[CB]SHELL\f[R] (plus \f[CB]USER\f[R] and
\f[CB]LOGNAME\f[R] if the target user is not root).
It is recommended to always use the \f[CB]\-\-login\f[R] option (instead
of its shortcut \-) to avoid side effects caused by mixing environments.
