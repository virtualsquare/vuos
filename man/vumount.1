.SH NAME
\f[CB]vumount\f[R] \[en] mount a filesystem or a resource
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[CB]vumount\f[R] [\f[I]options\f[R] \&...]
\f[I]source\f[R] \f[I]destination\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Everything is (or can be seen) as a file.
It is part of the philosophy of UNIX.
The file hierarchy is the global naming facility.
.PP
VUOS follows this principle: VUOS modules use \f[CB]mount\f[R](2) not
only to mount virtual filesystems but also to activate other virtual
services.
The mountpoint, \f[I]destination\f[R] in the synopsis, is the name that
will be used to identify the virtual entity/service.
.PP
For example, in \f[CB]vudev\f[R] it is possible to mount devices, in
\f[CB]vunet\f[R] the mountpoint is the name of the networking stack,
\f[CB]vustack\f[R](1) uses the path of the mountpoint to set the current
stack for processes.
.PP
\f[CB]vumount\f[R] is just a command interface to \f[CB]mount\f[R](2).
The \f[CB]mount\f[R](8) command is a complex tool which includes several
features like the management of /etc/fstab and /etc/mtab.
\f[CB]mount\f[R](8) is a root setuid executable and performs security
checks before the actual \f[CB]mount\f[R](2) syscall request.
\f[CB]mount\f[R](8) can be used in VUOS in place of \f[CB]vumount\f[R]
but it requires the (virtual) real uid of the executing process to be 0
(root).
e.g.\ \f[CB]vusu\f[R](1) can be used to set the virtual real uid to 0.
\f[CB]vumount\f[R] has been designed for VUOS but can be used to run the
\f[CB]mount\f[R] system call directly, without all the other management
actions provided by \f[CB]mount\f[R](8).
\f[CB]vumount\f[R] is not setuid root.
